Hello!
In case we have not met yet, my name is Jouse(Pronounced Jo-sway but I mostly go by Sway). This is my submission for the employee-directory project. There's a few things I want to point out right off the bat that I feel are important to share. 

1. This is my first project using Next.js and Prisma. 

My reasoning for taking this gamble is, that I wanted to show that I am completely capable of learning new technologies. I would say 90% of my projects up until this point were all in Ruby Rails. Considering most Full-Stack engieers work in Node and React, I wanted to show that I am capable in that regard. 

Side Note: Next.js is totally sick. Very impressed with how intuitive it felt.

So why Prisma? I am very familiar and comfortable with Rails' ActiveRecord I did some digging and found that this is pretty similar. It was actually very easy to set up. 

All in all, I would say that project took me 8 or so hours (if you don't count breaks I kept taking)

Because I was learning and going, there were a few things I did not have the time to accomplish. 

FEATURES:
- Full Stack with a filtered route for users that works with Prisma
- Jumping off the first bullet, I was able to implemenet a search bar which will filter based on department, name, title or location. 
- Create Form
- Delete Form
- Seeding from a third party person API
- Displays User Information is a neat manner


For Next Time: 

- Unit Testing: I am a bit familiar with RSPEC in rails but unfortunately I have not used Jest too much so I decided to leave it till the end if I had time. 

- Update Form: I was able to do a create an delete form but I ran out of time for the Update. I was able to show off the others at least

- CSS: I prioritized this last. It admittedly is not my strongest point so I do spend a lot of time on it. The app IS responsive though thanks to flex. 


That's all. I would love to discuss this further. Thanks again!
